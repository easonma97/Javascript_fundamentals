JavaScript has dynamic typing. 
We don't have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. 
Instead, data types are determined automatically.

Let/Const/Var
Let: define dynamic variable. Const: Define constant variable, need to be initialized, never change.

Operator Precedence
e.g. () > +,-,x,/ ...

Template literals (ES6)
`... ${...}, ${...}`
`String
multiple
lines` 
don't need to use \n to create a new line
