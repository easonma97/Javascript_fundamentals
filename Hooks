Handling Events?

<Event and State>
props start with 'on', e.g. onClick, onSubmit
E.g. onClick can let you make declarative stament on DOM EventListener

What is hooks?
useState, useEffect
* must be called directly inside the component function

useState with object initialized, how to make sure values inside the object will not get lost?
const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState({
  x : xx,
  y : yy,
  z : zz
});
setUserInput({
  ...userInput,
  x : xxx
})

CSS property name in JSX, all are camelCase.

- JSX Limitations & Fragments
* can't return more than one "root" JSX element.  -solution: always wrap adjacent elements
React.Fragment can reduce unnecessary div element.
