Handling Events?

<Event and State>
props start with 'on', e.g. onClick, onSubmit
E.g. onClick can let you make declarative stament on DOM EventListener

What is hooks?
useState, useEffect
* must be called directly inside the component function

useState with object initialized, how to make sure values inside the object will not get lost?
const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState({
  x : xx,
  y : yy,
  z : zz
});
setUserInput({
  ...userInput,
  x : xxx
})

CSS property name in JSX, all are camelCase.

- JSX Limitations & Fragments
* can't return more than one "root" JSX element.  -solution: always wrap adjacent elements
React.Fragment can reduce unnecessary div element.

- Getting a Cleaner DOM with Portals
ReactDOM.createPortal(<.. />, document.getElementById('..')) Move the html element of a particular react component to other places.
Semantically more correct html code

- Working with Refs
If you want to read the value, ref can be better than state

Effects, Reducers & Context
- Working with (Side) Effects
1.Store Data in Browser Storage
2.Send Http Requests to Backend Servers
3.Set & Manage Timers
There tasks must happen outside of the normal component evaluation and render cycle.

UseEffect: (function, dependencies)
You must add all "things" you use in your effect function if those "things" could change because your component (or some parent component) re-rendered. 

- Managing more Complex State with Reducers
- Managing App-Wide ore Component-Wide State with Context
